# DoublePendolum
Numerical Solution of the double pendolum problem. 
I tried to address the energy conservation problem, I looked for the initial conditions that lead the system to chaos and the ones that make the pensolum flip.

This repository contains the code and the plots relating to this project.

The gif representing two systems simultaneously shows that even with a difference in one angle of 10^-5 rad, the two pendolum diverge in their motion.
